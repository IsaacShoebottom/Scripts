# Vimm's Lair Downloader

Functional but less than optimal Vimm's lair downloader

Only tested on Wii games, but it could be adapted for other stuff

Created because I wanted to download without clicking overnight (does not bypass more than 1 file limit) 

But after doing some research and remembering I made my archive.org ROM downloader, which is very simple but more fully featured
